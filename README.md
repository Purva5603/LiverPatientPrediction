#  Liver Patient Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient is affected by **liver disease** based on clinical and demographic data. Early detection of liver disease can help in timely diagnosis and better treatment planning.

A **Logistic Regression model** was selected as the final model due to its strong performance, simplicity, and interpretability in medical prediction tasks.
